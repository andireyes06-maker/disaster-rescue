# HANDOFF

## Start here

**Project:** IT 305 final project, Disaster Rescue Reporting and Monitoring System (web + Flutter). Due Nov 2, 2026. Build window Oct 12 to 30.
**Path:** Big task. Brainstorm, X-SPEC.md, review against code, X-PLAN.md, then build. No code before spec approval.

**Status (Oct 15, 2026):**
- Brainstorm done. Brief read from `/Users/rien/Downloads/IT 305 - PROJECT 4.pdf`.
- `X-SPEC.md` APPROVED by Airen (2026-10-15). Photos decided: Cloudinary via API.
- git initialized, `.gitignore` added. Nothing else exists yet (no code).

**Decisions locked:**
- Full scope: all 15 FRs, 4 roles, 3 interfaces, built in vertical slices.
- Backend: Express API in front of Firebase (Auth, Firestore, FCM, Admin SDK). Reads live from Firestore, writes through API.
- Web: React + Vite. Mobile: Flutter (FLUTTER_STYLE_HANDOFF.md does NOT apply here).
- Maps: Leaflet/OSM (web), flutter_map/OSM (mobile). Responder UI on both web and Flutter.
- UI: "Calm Clarity" (off-white #F6F1EA, teal #0F6B66, coral #C83919 for critical only). Own direction, not the brief's navy and red.

**Next step:** Airen reviews X-PLAN.md (written 2026-10-15) and picks the execution method (subagent-driven or native). Then start Task 1 in Phase 1.

**Open questions:**
- Hosting for API and web app.
- Group size, leader, and roles (only needed for the contribution report).

**Gotchas:**
- Brief suggests PostgreSQL/MySQL, we use Firestore on purpose. Document it in the schema doc.
- No em dashes in user-facing text. Address the user as Airen.
- Cut order if late: PDF export, duplicate detection, DMO charts.
- Cannot verify here: Flutter on a real phone, real push notifications, GPS accuracy.

**Resume prompt:** "Read HANDOFF.md and X-SPEC.md in /Users/rien/Documents/FINAL_PROJECT. The spec is [approved / needs these changes: ...]. Continue to X-PLAN.md."
